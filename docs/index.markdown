  Shifting VisualCircuit to Web
---



VisualCircuit allows users to program robotic intelligence using a visual language which consists of blocks and wires, similar to electronic circuits. Currently it's a desktop application released for Linux based on IceStudio which uses AngularJS. The aim of this project is to make a similar web application so that users do not have to do any installation and use newer frameworks on the front-end since EOL for AngularJS is in December 2021. The requirements of the project are:

<ul>
  <li>Make a web app that has all the functionalities as the original desktop app.</li>
  <li>Add a django based wrapper to the existing backend so that it can communicate with the web-app.</li>
</ul>
